### Description

KeyStrat 1.7 is a fully working Keyboard Emulator. It includes many features such as different keyboard layouts and different key selection strategies. If anyone wants to develop the emulator further all that I ask is that you keep the KeyStrat name and mention me as the originator. (Requires VB6 Runtime library). Please take the time to vote / add your feedback, thanks!
